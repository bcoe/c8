Code-coverage using [Node.js' build in functionality](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v10.x/docs/api/cli.html#cli_node_v8_coverage_dir)
that's compatible with [Istanbul's reporters](https://istanbul.js.org/docs/advanced/alternative-reporters/).

Like [nyc](https://github.com/istanbuljs/nyc), c8 just magically works:

```bash
npm i c8 -g
c8 node foo.js
```

The above example will output coverage metrics for `foo.js`.

## c8 report

run `c8 report` to regenerate reports after `c8` has already been run.

## Supported Node.js Versions

c8 uses
[bleeding edge Node.js features](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/22527),
make sure you're running Node.js `>= 10.12.0`.

## Goals of the Project

A fully functional code coverage solution using only V8's native coverage
features and minimal user-land modules, so that we fit these constraints:

* No parsing of JavaScript code.
* No mucking with Node.js' runtime environment.
